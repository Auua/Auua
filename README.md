My name is Anna, and I'm a full-stack engineer currently based in Finland. I specialize in web application development using ReactJS and Java. I have been working in Fintech for the past 5 years. I really enjoy software development, where there are interesting challenges and endless possibilities.

While I do some coding during my free time, most of my projects are not public. However, feel free to check out whatever is available.

###  !! I am currently looking to relocate to Japan and explore new opportunities there.
